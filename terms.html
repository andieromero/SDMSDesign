        <li><strong>Dispute Resolution - </strong>If a dispute arises out of or relates to these Terms of Use, or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Rules before resorting to arbitration, litigation, or some other dispute resolution procedure. 

        Unless arbitration is expressly prohibited by applicable statute, or limited as set forth below, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the Emergency Interim Relief Procedures, by an arbitrator or arbitrators selected in accordance with such rules, as the exclusive remedy in any such dispute. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Arbitration shall occur in Malvern, Pennsylvania, and shall be governed by both the procedural and substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving effect to the principle of conflict of laws, unless specifically preempted by the United States Arbitration Act. Each party to the arbitration shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees, with the costs of the arbitration being divided equally among the parties. 

        Notwithstanding the arbitration provision above, Retail Up! and San Diego Music Studio may avail themselves of the full range of remedies available to them, either individual or together, in connection with any violation of its respective intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, temporary and permanent injunctive relief, and actions for damages in either state or federal courts, as applicable. If such judicial proceedings are instituted, the parties agree that such proceedings will not be stayed or delayed pending the outcome of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In such judicial proceedings, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and litigation costs, including those at the trial court and all appellate court levels, against the losing party. </li>
